# Linux Ransomeware sample
Made sample ransomeware for research. <br />
Using RSA publickey, AES-128-CBC mode. <br />
<br />
This code build by **GCC 4.8.5** <br />
And tested by CentOS 7.<br />
You should be careful execute binary file in ELF(**decrypt function is not implement.**)
<br />
<br />

<b>File info:<br /></b>
linux_ransom_sample.c
  - main function
  - travel all directory or specific directory(defined enc_dirs[])
  - file encrypt algorithm AES-128-CBC mode, encrypt key is encrypted by RSA public key.
  - build(with gcc):

  ```
  # gcc linux_ransom_sample.c -o linux_ransom_sample -lssl -lcrypto
  ```

scott_pub.pem
  - openssl rsa public key for encrypt aes crypto key.
  - generate command:

  ```
  # openssl genrsa -out private_key.pem 1024
  # openssl rsa -in private_key.pem -out public_key.pem -outform PEM -pubout
  ```
